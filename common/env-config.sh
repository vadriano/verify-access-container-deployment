# This script sets up environment variables for use by the rest of the Verify Identity Access Container Deployment scripts.
# This script is designed to be sourced from within other scripts so that variables are available on exit.

# If IPs or Versions updated here, you must also run compose/update-env-file.sh to update docker-compose project .env file.
# Kubernetes YAML files do not accept environment variables.  They must be updated by hand.

# IP addresses on local machine used for exposing ports from Docker containers.
# These should be mapped in /etc/hosts to appropriate hostnames
